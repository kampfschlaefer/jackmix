Installation
------------


To install JackMix you basicly need to do:
 scons

JackMix requires Qt4.2 or higher, the jack-audio-connection-kit
version 0.100.0 or higher and lash-1 version 0.5.1 or higher.
As of v 0.5.0 it also requires libasound (the alsa library) version 2
for MIDI signal routing.

Currently the buildsystem doesn't install the binary to some
extra place. If you want it to be installed, just copy jackmix/jackmix
to your destination of choice.

If you run into any other problems don't hesitate to contact me at
arnold@arnoldarts.de or on linux-audio-user@lists.linuxaudio.org.
Problems involving the MIDI control of the mixer are almost certainly
Nick Bailey's fault: nick@n-ism.org is the place to contact him.

Install Scons
	$ python3 -m pip install scons
      
Install Qt environment
	$ sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools
      
Install the jack-audio-connection-kit and compile it.
	$ git clone https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2.git
	Or download the source code via the link below.
	https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases/tag/v1.9.21
      
	Compile and install Jack2 , on linux, using './waf configure', './waf' and './waf install' as root. On macosx, users can use the xcode project. On Windows, users can use the Code::Blocks workspace (you also have a small script to make an all in one installer).
      
	Editing the configuration file
	
      	If your system has no directory called /etc/security/limits.d then you will need to edit /etc/security/limits.conf. If /etc/security/limits.d does exist on your machine, then you will need to create and edit a file called /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf. The file must contain (at least) the following two lines:
@audio   -  rtprio     95
@audio   -  memlock    unlimited
      	Contrary to a lot of misinformation on the web, there is no reason to include a line here that provides enhanced “niceness” control, which is completely irrelevant for realtime scheduling and low latency audio applications.
      
      	Creating an “audio” group
      		As the super-user (“root”) run the following commands from a terminal window:
		$ sudo groupadd audio
		$ sudo usermod -a -G audio yourUserID
      	Users should substitute their actual user id or “login” for “yourUserID”.
      
      	Users can carry out these two steps using the graphical tools available under the “System Administration” section of your desktop’s main menu. However, this text-based method is faster and much easier to explain.
      
      	Suppose users use a distribution that has already created the group and configured the “limits” file. In that case, users will need to determine the name of the group (it is likely called “audio” or “jackuser”). Then they can add themselves to the group with this command (run as the superuser inside a terminal window):
		$ usermod -a -G theGroupName yourUserID 
      
      	Logout and back in
      		None of the changes users have made above will affect users until they log out and back in. If that does not work, try rebooting. In either case, users do not need to reinstall any software.
      
Install alsa, libsound2-dev, linux-lowlatency, pulseaudio-module-jack, qjackctl
	$ sudo apt-get install alsa 
	$ sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
	$ sudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency
	$ sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-jack
	$ sudo apt-get install qjackctl

      	After completing the above steps, run qjackctl. Qjackctl is the basis for Jackmix to run. If qjackctl fails to run, Jackmix will not be available. 
       
      
Complie and run Jackmix
	The Jackmix project provides the SConstruct compilation file, so users can compile the entire Jackmix project by typing scons in the terminal and pressing enter. Once compiled, the executable jackmix file is generated in the /jackmix directory, and the graphical user interface appears after running jackmix successfully.
