JackMix is a matrix mixer allowing p input channels to be mixed into
q output channles by a matrix of faders. It relys on the Jack framework
to route these inputs and outputs.

This version of jackmix is enhanced for compatibility with an external
MIDI control surface.

It is based on Arnold Krille's version 0.4.2
